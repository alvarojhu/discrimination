    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value. Try using both the bootstrapping and the frequentist statistical approaches.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "4.) Deshawn Miller, a man of Lithuanian and Scottish descent, is applying for jobs and is not having very much success. He is finding that in order to get a single call back, he needs to send out at around 15 applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "One day, when arriving to the first day of practice for the basketball league he just joined, he introduces himself as Deshawn and almost every one of his team mates responded with something along the lines, \"You're white?!? When I heard Deshawn, I automatically thought you were going to be black!\" This got Deshawn thinking. If his team mates thought, based solely on his name, that he was a black man, then maybe so were employers. And if employers thought he was black, then there might be a possibility that they were exhibiting a bias against him (whether it be implicit or explicit). \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to test his hypothesis, he makes a simple change to his resume; he changes \"Deshawn\" to \"Sean\". After this simple change, he notices that he is consistently getting call back after about only 10 applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since Deshawn is only one person and he cannot really tell how accurate or repeatable this finding is, he does a study with 1,000 people. He asks them to send out 2 different resumes. One with their actual name, and one with a \"black\" or \"white\" version of their name. The results seemed to fall in line with what he was suspecting. He found that out of the 1000 applicants, there was a 3% difference for callbacks between the \"white\" and \"black\" names, in favor of the whites. Since this is still not a very big number, he runs 10,000 permutations of the data, meaning he shuffles the data, and randomly selects half of them to be \"white\" and half of the to be \"black\". He then finds the differences between all 10,000 runs. What he discovered was shocking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of all 10,000 permutations, **only in one instance was there as big of a difference in call backs.** This has led Deshawn to believe that **there is a real difference between call backs based on whether or not you have a black or white sounding name.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When running the permutations, 95% of all differences landed between +/- 1.5%, and the real difference was over 3%. Needless to day, he will continue using Shawn as his name on his applications moving forward. "

    "\n",
    "The way I would adjust my analysis would be to run all the different variables through the function I wrote and see if there is a difference in call back success. Some possible variables that might have an affect that I see are military, years of experience, and number of jobs. I would then compare the differences amongst one another and see which one has the strongest correlation, or the lowest p value, and deem that one as the most important of the bunch. \n"
